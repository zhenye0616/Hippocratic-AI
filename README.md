# Hippocratic AI Coding Assignment
Welcome to the [Hippocratic AI](https://www.hippocraticai.com) coding assignment

## Instructions
The attached code is a simple python script skeleton. Your goal is to take any simple bedtime story request and use prompting to tell a story appropriate for ages 5 to 10.
- Incorporate a LLM judge to improve the quality of the story
- Provide a block diagram of the system you create that illustrates the flow of the prompts and the interaction between judge, storyteller, user, and any other components you add
- Do not change the openAI model that is being used. 
- Please use your own openAI key, but do not include it in your final submission.
- Otherwise, you may change any code you like or add any files

---

## Rules
- This assignment is open-ended
- You may use any resources you like with the following restrictions
   - They must be resources that would be available to you if you worked here (so no other humans, no closed AIs, no unlicensed code, etc.)
   - Allowed resources include but not limited to Stack overflow, random blogs, chatGPT et al
   - You have to be able to explain how the code works, even if chatGPT wrote it
- DO NOT PUSH THE API KEY TO GITHUB. OpenAI will automatically delete it

## What does "tell a story" mean?
It should be appropriate for ages 5-10. Other than that it's up to you. Here are some ideas to help get the brain-juices flowing!
- Use story arcs to tell better stories
- Allow the user to provide feedback or request changes
- Categorize the request and use a tailored generation strategy for each category

---

## How will I be evaluated
Good question. We want to know the following:
- The efficacy of the system you design to create a good story
- Are you comfortable using and writing a python script
- What kinds of prompting strategies and agent design strategies do you use
- Are the stories your tool creates good?
- Can you understand and deconstruct a problem
- Can you operate in an open-ended environment
- Can you surprise us

---

## Other FAQs
- How long should I spend on this? 
No more than 2-3 hours
- Can I change what the input is? 
Sure
- How long should the story be?
You decide

## Docker quickstart
Build the image (once) from the project root:
```bash
docker build -t bedtime-storyteller .
```

Run the CLI and pass your OpenAI key at runtime:
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key \
  bedtime-storyteller
```

If you keep your key in a `.env` file, mount it and the app will load it automatically:
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
  --env-file .env \
  bedtime-storyteller
```

---

## Local quickstart (without Docker)
1. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Set your OpenAI key (or place it in `.env`):
   ```bash
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key
   ```
4. Run the CLI:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## System diagram
See `block_diagram.md` for a Mermaid diagram of the user → storyteller → judge feedback loop.
